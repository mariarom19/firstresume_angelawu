    and I have a  <a href="https://discord.gg/sCVjfwdZR6">film club </a> all about 𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞, 𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫, 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥, 𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐭, 𝐛-𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞, 𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚 and 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 films. (+18 only)
    You can get an idea of the type of films we stream by checking out our logged/streamed films in <a href="https://letterboxd.com/watchandwine/films/">here </a> </p>
